Reduce cyclic model size by using the mesh skin for result and mesh extraction
==============================================================================
This example shows postprocessing on a mesh skin for a cyclic model analysis.
The skin mesh is rebuilt with new surface elements connecting the nodes on the external skin
of the solid mesh. These surface elements types are chosen with respect to the solid elements
facets having all their nodes on the skin.

This feature, available for all types of mechanical simulation supporting cyclic
or cyclic multi-stage models, allows you to reduce the size of both the mesh
and extracted data to improve processing performance. Because larger stresses and
strains are usually located on the skin of a model, computing results on the skin gives
equivalent maximum values in most cases.

Postprocessing of elemental or elemental nodal results requires an element solid-to-skin mapping
to get from a solid element result to a facet result. Because the connectivity of the new surface
elements built on the skin are different from the connectivity of the solid elements, small
differences can be found after result averaging.

To plot cyclic expanded results, the skin mesh is expanded.
