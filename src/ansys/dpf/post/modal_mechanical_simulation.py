        Arguments `selection`, `set_ids`, `all_sets`, `frequencies`, and `modes` are mutually
        exclusive.
        If none of the above is given, only the first mode will be returned.

        Arguments `selection`, `named_selections`, `element_ids`, and `node_ids` are mutually
        exclusive.
        If none of the above is given, results will be extracted for the whole mesh.

        Parameters
        ----------
        base_name:
            Base name for the requested result.
        location:
            Location to extract results at. Available locations are listed in
            class:`post.locations` and are: `post.locations.nodal`,
            `post.locations.elemental`, and `post.locations.elemental_nodal`.
            Using the default `post.locations.elemental_nodal` results in a value
            for every node at each element. Similarly, using `post.locations.elemental`
            gives results with one value for each element, while using `post.locations.nodal`
            gives results with one value for each node.
        category:
            Type of result requested. See the :class:`ResultCategory` class.
        components:
            Components to get results for.
        norm:
            Whether to return the norm of the results.
        selection:
            Selection to get results for.
            A Selection defines both spatial and time-like criteria for filtering.
        frequencies:
            Frequency value or list of frequency values to get results for.
        set_ids:
            List of sets to get results for.
            A set is defined as a unique combination of {time, load step, sub-step}.
        all_sets:
            Whether to get results for all sets/modes.
        modes:
            Mode number or list of mode numbers to get results for.
        node_ids:
            List of IDs of nodes to get results for.
        element_ids:
            List of IDs of elements to get results for.
        named_selections:
            Named selection or list of named selections to get results for.
        expand_cyclic:
            For cyclic problems, whether to expand the sectors.
            Can take a list of sector numbers to select specific sectors to expand
            (one-based indexing).
            If the problem is multi-stage, can take a list of lists of sector numbers, ordered
            by stage.
        phase_angle_cyclic:
             For cyclic problems, phase angle to apply (in degrees).
        external_layer:
             Select the external layer (last layer of solid elements under the skin)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the external
             layer is computed over list of elements.
        skin:
             Select the skin (creates new 2D elements connecting the external nodes)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the skin
             is computed over list of elements (not supported for cyclic symmetry). Getting the
             skin on more than one result (several time freq sets, split data...) is only
             supported starting with Ansys 2023R2.

        Returns
        -------
        Returns a :class:`ansys.dpf.post.data_object.DataFrame` instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        node_ids:
            List of IDs of nodes to get results for.
        element_ids:
            List of IDs of elements to get results for.
        frequencies:
            Frequency value or list of frequency values to get results for.
        components:
            Components to get results for. Available components are "X", "Y", "Z", "XX", "XY",
            "XZ", and their respective equivalents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
        modes:
            Mode number or list of mode numbers to get results for.
        named_selections:
            Named selection or list of named selections to get results for.
        selection:
            Selection to get results for.
            A Selection defines both spatial and time-like criteria for filtering.
        location:
            Location to extract results at. Available locations are listed in
            class:`post.locations` and are: `post.locations.nodal`,
            `post.locations.elemental`, and `post.locations.elemental_nodal`.
            Using the default `post.locations.elemental_nodal` results in a value
            for every node at each element. Similarly, using `post.locations.elemental`
            gives results with one value for each element, while using `post.locations.nodal`
            gives results with one value for each node.
        set_ids:
            Sets to get results for. Equivalent to modes.
            Common to all simulation types for easier scripting.
        all_sets:
            Whether to get results for all sets/modes.
        expand_cyclic:
            For cyclic problems, whether to expand the sectors.
            Can take a list of sector numbers to select specific sectors to expand
            (one-based indexing).
            If the problem is multi-stage, can take a list of lists of sector numbers, ordered
            by stage.
        phase_angle_cyclic:
             For cyclic problems, phase angle to apply (in degrees).
        external_layer:
             Select the external layer (last layer of solid elements under the skin)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the external
             layer is computed over list of elements.
        skin:
             Select the skin (creates new 2D elements connecting the external nodes)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the skin
             is computed over list of elements (not supported for cyclic symmetry). Getting the
             skin on more than one result (several time freq sets, split data...) is only
             supported starting with Ansys 2023R2.

            List of IDs of nodes to get results for.
        element_ids:
            List of IDs of elements to get results for.
        frequencies:
            Frequency value or list of frequency values to get results for.
        modes:
            Mode number or list of mode numbers to get results for.
        named_selections:
            Named selection or list of named selections to get results for.
        selection:
            Selection to get results for.
            A Selection defines both spatial and time-like criteria for filtering.
        location:
            Location to extract results at. Available locations are listed in
            class:`post.locations` and are: `post.locations.nodal`,
            `post.locations.elemental`, and `post.locations.elemental_nodal`.
            Using the default `post.locations.elemental_nodal` results in a value
            for every node at each element. Similarly, using `post.locations.elemental`
            gives results with one value for each element, while using `post.locations.nodal`
            gives results with one value for each node.
        set_ids:
            Sets to get results for. Equivalent to modes.
            Common to all simulation types for easier scripting.
        all_sets:
            Whether to get results for all sets/modes.
        expand_cyclic:
            For cyclic problems, whether to expand the sectors.
            Can take a list of sector numbers to select specific sectors to expand
            (one-based indexing).
            If the problem is multi-stage, can take a list of lists of sector numbers, ordered
            by stage.
        phase_angle_cyclic:
             For cyclic problems, phase angle to apply (in degrees).
        external_layer:
             Select the external layer (last layer of solid elements under the skin)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the external
             layer is computed over list of elements.
        skin:
             Select the skin (creates new 2D elements connecting the external nodes)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the skin
             is computed over list of elements (not supported for cyclic symmetry). Getting the
             skin on more than one result (several time freq sets, split data...) is only
             supported starting with Ansys 2023R2.

             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the external
             layer is computed over list of elements.
        skin:
             Select the skin (creates new 2D elements connecting the external nodes)

        Parameters
        ----------
        node_ids:
            List of IDs of nodes to get results for.
        element_ids:
            List of IDs of elements to get results for.

            Frequency value or list of frequency values to get results for.
        modes:
            Mode number or list of mode numbers to get results for.
        named_selections:
            Named selection or list of named selections to get results for.
        selection:
            Selection to get results for.
            A Selection defines both spatial and time-like criteria for filtering.
        set_ids:
            Sets to get results for. Equivalent to modes.
            Common to all simulation types for easier scripting.
        all_sets:
            Whether to get results for all sets/modes.
        expand_cyclic:
            For cyclic problems, whether to expand the sectors.
            Can take a list of sector numbers to select specific sectors to expand
            (one-based indexing).
            If the problem is multi-stage, can take a list of lists of sector numbers, ordered
            by stage.
        phase_angle_cyclic:
             For cyclic problems, phase angle to apply (in degrees).
        external_layer:
             Select the external layer (last layer of solid elements under the skin)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the external
             layer is computed over list of elements.
        skin:
             Select the skin (creates new 2D elements connecting the external nodes)
             of the mesh for plotting and data extraction. If a list is passed, the skin
             is computed over list of elements (not supported for cyclic symmetry). Getting the
             skin on more than one result (several time freq sets, split data...) is only
