=============

PyDPF-Post supports Windows 10 and CentOS 7 and later. For
more information, see `Ansys Platform Support <https://www.ansys.com/solutions/solutions-by-role/it-professionals/platform-support>`_.

Other platforms may be supported by using PyDPF-Post in a
containerized ecosystem, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ or
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_.

Due to potential crashes when using PyDPF-Post 0.2.2 or earlier with PyDPF-Core 0.5.2
or later, you should refer to the following table for compatibility between these two
libraries.
