Getting started
===============

To use the PyDPF-Post API, you must have PyDPF-Core installed. Because you need to
use a native DPF server, you must also have a local installation of Ansys 2021 R1
or later. For more information on getting a licensed copy of Ansys, visit the
`Ansys website <https://www.ansys.com/>`_.
