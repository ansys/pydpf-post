DPF-Post API
============
This guide provides an overview of the DPF-Post API.

DPF-Post leverages three main categories of objects: 

1. **Solution**: it is the entry point to the results file, its
   metadata and contents.

2. **Result**: it provides access to specific result types, in
   accordance with the type of analysis.

3. **ResultData**: it provides access to the actual data values and
   closely relates to the DPF-Core "Fields Container" concept.
