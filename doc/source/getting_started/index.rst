Getting started
===============

To use the PyDPF-Post API, you must have PyDPF-Core installed. Because you need to
use a native DPF server, you must also have a local installation of Ansys 2021 R1
or later or of the standalone DPF Server.
For more information on getting a licensed copy of Ansys, visit the
`Ansys website <https://www.ansys.com/>`_.
For more information on getting the standalone DPF Server, visit the
`PyDPF-Core documentation <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/getting_started/dpf_server.html>`_.
