Platform support
----------------

PyDPF-Post supports Windows 10 and CentOS 7 and later. For more information,
see `Platform Support <https://www.ansys.com/solutions/solutions-by-role/it-professionals/platform-support>`_
on the Ansys web site.

Other platforms may be supported by using PyDPF-Post in a
containerized ecosystem, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ or
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_.

PyDPF-Core and DPF server
-------------------------

To use PyDPF-Post, you must have `PyDPF-Core <https://github.com/ansys/pydpf-core>`_
installed. Because you must use a native DPF server, you must also have a local
installation of either Ansys 2021 R1 or later or a standalone DPF server.

- For more information on getting a licensed copy of Ansys, visit the
  `Ansys website <https://www.ansys.com/>`_.
- For more information on installing a standalone DPF server, see
  `Getting started <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/getting_started/dpf_server.html>`_
  in the PyDPF-Core documentation.
