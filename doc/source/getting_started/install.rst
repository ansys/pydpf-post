Installation
************
After all :ref:`software requirements <software_requirements>` are installed, you can install PyDPF-Post.

Install using ``pip``
---------------------

The standard package installer for Python is `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_.

To use PyDPF-Post with Ansys 2021 R1 or later, install the latest version
with this command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ansys-dpf-post

Alternatively, you can also clone and install the latest version of PyDPF-Post from its GitHub
repository with these commands:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/ansys/pydpf-post
   cd pydpf-post
   pip install . --userpip install ansys-dpf-post

PyDPF-Post plotting capabilities require an installation of `PyVista <https://pyvista.org/>`_.
To install PyDPF-Post with its optional plotting functionalities, use this command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ansys-dpf-post[plotting]

For more information about PyDPF-Post plotting capabilities, see :ref:`user_guide_plotting`.


Install without internet
------------------------

If you are unable to install PyDPF-Post on the host machine using ``pip`` due to
network isolation, you can download the wheel file corresponding to your platform
and Python interpreter version. To obtain the latest release, go to the **Assets** section
for the `latest PyDPF-Post release <https://github.com/ansys/pydpf-post/releases/latest>`_ on GitHub.

A Python wheel file is essentially a ZIP archive containing Python wheel files for all the packages
that PyDPF-Post requires to run. To install PyDPF-Post using the downloaded wheel file, unzip this file
to a local directory and then run this command from within this local directory:

.. code:: bash

   pip install --no-index --find-links=. ansys-dpf-post

Beware that PyDPF-Post wheel files do not include the optional plotting dependencies.
To allow for plotting capabilities, also download the `PyVista wheel file <https://pypi.org/project/pyvista/#files>`_,
unzip it to the same local directory, and run the preceding command again.

Check the installation
----------------------

Run this Python code to verify your PyDPF-Post installation:

.. code:: bash

   from ansys.dpf import post
   from ansys.dpf.post import examples
   simulation = post.load_simulation(examples.simple_bar)
   print(simulation)
