=========================
Change the server context
=========================

When using a DPF server version later than Ansys 2023 R1, the DPF server context controls Ansys license
interactions.

- When the **Premium** DPF server context is active, underlying operations check if a valid
  Ansys license exists and are allowed to check out this license if needed. This means that all DPF
  features are available, but a license may be checked out.
- When the **Entry** DPF server context is active, underlying operations check if a valid Ansys
  license exists but are not allowed to check out any license. This means that operations that require
  the license be checked out are not available and raise an error.

By default, using PyDPF-Post starts a DPF server with the **Premium** context active.
For more information, search the `PyDPF-Core documentation <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/dev/user_guide/server_context.html>`_
for  **Premium** and **Entry**.

Change the default server context
---------------------------------

The default context for the DPF server is **Premium**. You can change the context using
the ``ANSYS_DPF_SERVER_CONTEXT`` environment variable. For more information, see
`ServerContext <https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/api/ansys.dpf.core.server_context.html>`_ in
the PyDPF-Core API documentation.

You can also change the DPF server context with this code:

.. code-block::

    from ansys.dpf import post
    post.set_default_server_context(post.AvailableServerContexts.entry)


Release history
---------------

The **Entry** DPF server context is available in DPF Server version 6.0
(Ansys 2023 R2) and later.

With a DPF Server version earlier than 6.0 (Ansys 2023 R1 and earlier),
**Premium** is the default context. All operations are available,
depending only on their release dates.
